<p data-start="1132" data-end="1642">Start by deciding what type of experience you want. Do you crave coastal drives, mountain escapades, or desert adventures? For example, a coastal road trip along the Pacific Coast Highway in California offers jaw-dropping ocean views, charming seaside towns, and some of the best beaches in the United States.

<p data-start="5822" data-end="6162">If you prefer a more adventurous approach, they can also suggest camping spots in national parks or off-the-grid locations where you can truly disconnect from the world. The beauty of a road trip is that you can adjust your plans on the fly, but having a few well-chosen accommodations pre-arranged will ensure that your trip goes smoothly.</p>
